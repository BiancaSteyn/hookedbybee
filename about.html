      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi there! I'm Bee — a young entrepreneur with a passion for handmade creations and cozy comforts.  
        Crochet started as a hobby and quickly grew into something I love sharing with others.  
        In my free time, I enjoy crocheting, reading good books, and when inspiration strikes — writing a little myself!  
        I’ve even published a book, and now I’m simply exploring where life takes me.  
      </p>
      <p>
        When I’m not crocheting, you can usually find me teaching as a full-time swimming instructor,  
        which doesn’t leave me with much free time — but every stitch I make is filled with love and dedication.  
        I’m also currently studying law, balancing my creative and academic passions one day at a time. 💜
      </p>

      <h2>Need More Information?</h2>
      <p>
        When placing an order, I always try to respond as soon as possible.  
        Sometimes I might be in the pool (literally 🏊‍♀️), so please be patient if I can’t reply immediately —  
        I’ll get back to you as soon as I climb out!  
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of my busy schedule, creating each item might take a little extra time,  
        but I promise to dedicate every spare moment to completing your order as soon as possible.  
      </p>
      <p>
        For larger or multiple-item orders, I do require a **deposit** to cover yarn and materials.  
        Full payment is required before delivery.  
        If a third-party delivery service is needed, customers are responsible for **80% of the delivery cost**.  
        Thank you for your understanding and support — every order means the world to me! 🐝✨
      </p>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Materials Used</h2>
      <p>
        I use a variety of yarns depending on the project — from soft cotton and premium acrylic to chunky textured blends.  
        You can even **customize your yarn type or color** when placing your order!  
      </p>
      <p>
        For amigurumi and stuffed animals, I use safety-pegged eyes, durable stuffing, and sometimes a bit of flexible wire  
        for structure (depending on the design).  
        Everything is assembled carefully to ensure your handmade piece is both adorable and long-lasting. 🧶

      <h2>Source Supplies</h2>
      <p>
        Most of my yarn and crochet supplies come from <strong>Habby Hyper</strong> — my go-to store for quality materials!  
        Occasionally, I also purchase from <strong>Temu</strong>, <strong>Shein</strong>, and <strong>ValueCo</strong>  
        when I need something unique or hard to find locally.
